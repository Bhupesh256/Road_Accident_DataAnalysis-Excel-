# Road Accident Data Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is an **Excel-based interactive dashboard** developed to analyze road accident data, identify trends, and highlight key performance indicators (KPIs).  
The dashboard aims to support **data-driven decision-making** for road safety improvements by providing clear and structured visual insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Analyze **total casualties** by severity, month, road type, and surface condition.
- Compare accident patterns between different years.
- Present findings in an **interactive dashboard** using Excel.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains accident records with details such as:
- **Accident Severity** (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
- **Date & Month**
- **Road Type** (Single carriageway, Dual carriageway, Roundabout, etc.)
- **Road Surface Condition** (Dry, Wet, Snow/Ice)
- **Number of Casualties**

> **Source:** Sample dataset based on publicly available UK road accident data.

## ðŸ“Š Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
| KPI | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Total Casualties** | 417,882 |
| **Fatal Casualties** | 7,135 |
| **Serious Casualties** | 59,312 |
| **Slight Casualties** | 351,435 |

### Additional Insights:
- **Monthly Trends:** Compared for **2021** and **2022**; highest casualties in May 2021 and June 2022.
- **Road Type Impact:** Highest number of casualties on **Single carriageways**.
- **Road Surface Impact:** Majority of accidents occurred on **Dry surfaces**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Features
- **Interactive Slicers** to filter by:
  - Year
  - Accident Severity
  - Road Type
  - Surface Condition
- **Monthly Trend Line Chart** for seasonal patterns.
- **Donut & Bar Charts** for proportional and comparative analysis.
- **KPI Cards** for quick summary metrics.
